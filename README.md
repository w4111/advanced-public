## Advanced Assignments (AA)

The series of advanced assignments will ask you to write programs or edit a simple database to turn the concepts discussed in class into actual code.  Some of these will be self-contained assignments, and some will add new features or improvements into a simple Python-based query engine called  [DataBass](https://www.github.com/w4111/databass).

You will recieve extra credit equivalent to one homework assignment.  AA4 is worth more because it's more involved.

* [AA1: Implement OFFSET in DataBass](./databass/offset.md)
* [AA2: Query Compilation](./databass/compile.md)
* [AA3: Fun with Window Functions](./window.md)
* [AA4: Join Optimization](./databass/join.md)
